Changes included in patch: (all merged in from AMC version mc-4.1.35-A12pre)

- EXTFS Support for the ESP archiver ('uesp' added where needed)
- (commented out) support for .deb on dpkg-less systems
  (users just need to move # 2 lines up :))
- New .sytnax files for BAssPasC, Macro-HTML, J(Dis)Asm languages
- (mostly) Color changes in HTML, LSM, Makefile .syntax files, to make
  them (more) readable on blue background
  (who the fsck thought that dark brown on dark red is readable?)
- .sytnax file mapping for .syntax files moved to top, so editing files
  like Makefile.syntax is colored now :) (it matched the Makefile.* rule)
